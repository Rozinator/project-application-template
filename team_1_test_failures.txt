Command: python3 -m coverage run -m unittest discover tests

Output:
/Users/longlee/.matplotlib is not a writable directory
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /var/folders/3z/fl0f61gs3bl55q1p8tqlm8w00000gn/T/matplotlib-cg7i7ptx because there was an issue with the default path (/Users/longlee/.matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.
